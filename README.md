# filesort
Sorts the mess of files in the download directory into separate directories corresponding to their file type

It works by recognizing the ending of files, and comparing it to a list of file types. It will then move the files to a directory corresponding to what kind of file it is(e.g. Documents, Compressed archives, Media files etc.).
The list of recognized file types can be expanded if needed.
